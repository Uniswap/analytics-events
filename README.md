## Release

Releasing is performed manually using the [release](/.github/workflows/release.yaml) Github workflow.

This repository uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for the release process,
which in turn uses the [Angular commit message suggestions](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to identify the type of release.

## Documentation

The top level folders such as [Interface](./src/interface) contain application specific data. This data gives context to the event being logged. Add a new folder for every new application being added.

The top level files, such as [primitives](./src//primitives.ts) contain generic data that is supposed to be reused by different applications. This data describes the events being logged, such as `EventName.MENU_CLICK`, which reflects an event on a menu. Specific event context should be captured in additional fields beyond the event name to create user-friendly hierarchy groupings.

## Example Apps

This package is used into a few of Uniswap Labs repos:

- [Interface](https://github.com/Uniswap/widgets-demo/tree/nextjs)
- [Docs](https://github.com/Uniswap/docs)
